# Adult-census-income-analysis-using-ANN
Abstract: Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Census Income" dataset.

We can build neural networks for the machine learning data

Upto data pre-processing steps in machine learning , we can follow the same for neural networks

The only change will be model building

Taking Adult Income dataset for the analysis

15. Income : >50K, <=50K

Here we have 14 Input Variables and 1 output variable(Income)
